## About

The Master Python Curriculum is an open-source, structured guide to learning Python step by step:

- Volume 1: Python Foundations (ready)
- Volumes 2-8: Coming soon (placeholders marked "Under Construction")

Each volume contains bite-sized chapters in Markdown format and ends with a capstone project.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

## Development

This site is built with MkDocs (https://www.mkdocs.org/) and mkdocs-material (https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).

## Build locally
    pip install mkdocs mkdocs-material
    mkdocs serve

Then open http://127.0.0.1:8000 in your browser.

## Deploy manually
    mkdocs gh-deploy

## Auto-deploy
Pushing to the main branch triggers a GitHub Actions workflow that auto-builds and deploys the site to GitHub Pages.
