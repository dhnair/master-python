## End-of-Volume Project
57. **Capstone Project**:  
   Build an **Algorithmic Challenge Toolkit**:  
   - Implement a set of classic algorithms and data structures  
   - Include CLI interface to run/search/test algorithms  
   - Apply to solve a real-world problem (e.g., shortest path finder, text search engine, or scheduling system)
