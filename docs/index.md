# Master Python Curriculum

Welcome to the **Master Python Curriculum**, an open-source learning project designed to take you from **absolute beginner** in Python all the way to **advanced programming** and even **quantum computing**.

This is not just another tutorial series. It is a **structured curriculum** with volumes, chapters, and projects — designed for gradual learning.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

## `📚` What You Will Learn

The curriculum is divided into **8 volumes**:

1. **Python Foundations** — Learn the basics of Python, data types, control flow, functions, file handling, and OOP.  
   `✅` Fully available now.  

2. **Python for Web Development** — Frameworks like Flask, Django, and FastAPI.  
   `🚧` Under construction.  

3. **Python for Data Science** — NumPy, pandas, visualization, machine learning.  
   `🚧` Under construction.  

4. **System Automation and DevOps** — Automation, CI/CD, cloud, and infrastructure scripting.  
   `🚧` Under construction.  

5. **Application Development** — GUI, desktop, and cross-platform app development.  
   `🚧` Under construction.  

6. **Advanced Python** — Concurrency, metaprogramming, design patterns, and performance.  
   `🚧` Under construction.  

7. **Data Structures and Algorithms** — Core CS concepts implemented in Python.  
   `🚧` Under construction.  

8. **Quantum Computing** — Explore quantum computing using Python libraries like Qiskit.  
   `🚧` Under construction.  

-------------------------------------------------------------------

## `🚀` How to Get Started

- Begin with [Volume 1: Python Foundations](Volume1_Foundations.md).  
- Each chapter is **short and focused** on one concept.  
- At the end of each volume, a **Capstone Project** brings everything together.  

-------------------------------------------------------------------

## `🧑‍🤝‍🧑` Open Source and Community

This curriculum is **open-source** and will grow with community contributions.  
You can help by fixing typos, improving explanations, or writing new chapters.
