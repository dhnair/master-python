# Curriculum
---
Welcome to **Master Python**, an open-source learning project designed to take you from **absolute beginner** in Python all the way to **advanced programming** and even **quantum computing**.

This is not just another tutorial series. It is a **structured curriculum** with volumes, chapters, and projects — designed for gradual learning.

---

## `📚` What You Will Learn  

The curriculum is divided into **9 volumes**, with both **core learning** and **application-focused** tracks.  

### 🔑 Core Python & CS  
1. [**Python Foundations**](volume_1/python_foundations) — Learn the basics of Python: data types, control flow, functions, file handling, and OOP.  
   `✅` Fully available now.  

2. **Python Beyond Basics** — Level up your skills: decorators, iterators, generators, advanced OOP, testing, and Pythonic best practices.  
   `🚧` Planned.  

3. **Advanced Python** *(Optional for fast-track learners)* — Dive into concurrency, metaprogramming, design patterns, and performance.  
   `🚧` Planned.  

4. **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** *(Optional for fast-track learners)* — Core CS concepts: linked lists, trees, graphs, sorting, and problem-solving patterns.  
   `🚧` Planned.  

### 🚀 Real-World Applications  
5. **Python for Web Development** — Frameworks like Flask, Django, and FastAPI.  
   `🚧` Planned.  

6. **Python for Data Science** — NumPy, pandas, visualization, machine learning.  
   `🚧` Planned.  

7. **System Automation and DevOps** — Automation, CI/CD, cloud, and infrastructure scripting.  
   `🚧` Planned.  

8. **Application Development** — GUI, desktop, and cross-platform app development.  
   `🚧` Planned.  

9. **Quantum Computing** — Explore quantum computing using Python libraries like Qiskit.  
   `🚧` Planned.

## `🛤️` Choose Your Path  

- **Full Track:** Follow the order (Vol 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → Applications) for maximum depth and mastery.  
- **Fast Track:** If your goal is to quickly build real-world projects, start with Vol 1 → 2 → then skip ahead to Web or Data Science. Return to *Advanced Python* and *DSA* later when ready.  

---

## `🚀` How to Get Started  

- Begin with [**Volume 1: Python Foundations**](volume_1/python_foundations) 
- Each chapter is **short and focused** on one concept.  
- At the end of each volume, a **Capstone Project** brings everything together.
