# Capstone Project: File Manager CLI
## Chapter 66: Project Overview

### 1. Introduction
In this capstone project, we will build a **Command-Line Interface (CLI) File Manager**.  
This project will tie together everything learned in **Volume 1: Foundations**:  
- Variables and data types  
- Control flow (if/else, loops)  
- Functions and modules  
- File handling (text, binary)  
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  

The goal is to simulate a **real-world project** while reinforcing Python fundamentals.

### 2. Why a File Manager?
A file manager is a practical project because:
- Every operating system uses files and directories.  
- It provides hands-on experience with file handling.  
- It combines multiple programming concepts in a meaningful way.  
- It can grow into a more advanced tool in later volumes (e.g., with GUIs, networking).  

---

### 3. Project Objectives
By the end of this project, learners will be able to:
1. Create a CLI tool using Python.  
2. Navigate directories and manage files.  
3. Handle user input and provide meaningful feedback.  
4. Implement error handling for real-world scenarios.  
5. Refactor procedural code into OOP.  

---

### 4. Planned Features
The File Manager CLI will support the following commands:
- **list** → show files and directories in the current folder  
- **create** → create new files or directories  
- **delete** → remove files or directories  
- **move** → move files from one location to another  
- **copy** → copy files  
- **read** → display file contents  
- **write** → write new content into a file  
- **search** → find files by name or extension  

---

### 5. Tools and Libraries
We will use only the **Python Standard Library**:
- `os` and `os.path` → file and directory operations  
- `shutil` → copy and move files  
- `argparse` → parsing command-line arguments  
- `sys` → handling errors and exits  

---

### 6. Workflow
The project will progress through these stages:
1. **Basic CLI skeleton** — learn how to handle commands.  
2. **File operations** — implement read/write/delete.  
3. **Directory operations** — implement list/create/move.  
4. **Search and filters** — extend functionality.  
5. **Error handling** — make it robust.  
6. **OOP refactor** — turn it into a class-based design.  
7. **Enhancements** — optional improvements.  

---

### 7. Expected Outcome
At the end of this capstone, you will have:
- A **working CLI tool** you can run from the terminal.  
- Experience designing, building, and testing a larger program.  
- Confidence in applying Python fundamentals to real projects.  

---

### 8. Next Steps
✅ Now that we understand the project scope and goals, let’s move on to **Chapter 2: Basic Structure**, where we will set up the CLI entry point.
