# Master Python Curriculum

An open-source, structured curriculum for learning Python from absolute foundations to advanced topics -- including web development, data science, DevOps, application building, advanced Python, algorithms, and even quantum computing.

## Volumes

1. [**Volume 1: Python Foundations**](Volume1_Foundations_Index.md)

   - **Capstone**: Build a File Manager CLI.

2. [**Volume 2: Web Development with Python**](Volume2_Web_Development.md)
   - HTTP basics, Flask, Django, FastAPI, templates, forms, ORM, authentication, testing, deployment.
   - **Capstone**: Build and deploy a multi-user blog platform.

3. [**Volume 3: Data Science, AI, and ML with Python**](Volume3_Data_Science.md)
   - Math foundations, NumPy, Pandas, data cleaning, visualization, scikit-learn, ML workflows, neural nets.

   - Complexity analysis, arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, recursion, trees, graphs, sorting, searching, hashing, dynamic programming, greedy, backtracking.
   - **Capstone**: Build a mini DSA library in Python.

8. [**Volume 8: Quantum Computing with Python (Qiskit)**](Volume8_Quantum_Computing.md)
   - Quantum theory basics, qubits, gates, circuits, measurement, Qiskit circuits, simulation, IBM Quantum backends, algorithms, quantum ML.
   - **Capstone**: Build and run a quantum circuit with Qiskit.
   - 

Each volume contains bite-sized chapters in Markdown format, plus a capstone project to put concepts into practice.

## Getting Started

You don’t need to download anything — all chapters are written in Markdown and can be read directly here on GitHub.

- Start with [Volume 1 Index](Volume1_Foundations_Index.md).
- Use the links inside each index to navigate through chapters.
- Each volume ends with a capstone project that ties the concepts together.
